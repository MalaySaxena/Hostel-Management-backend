# Hostel Management backend

## Goals

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Requirements 
* Any operating system (i.e. Linux, Windows, MacOS X)
* A little knowledge of Dart and Flutter. Don't worry if you are new to it, you just need knack to learn.
* Any IDE for Python (i.e. VSCode, Pycharm etc)

## Development Setup

The development environment requires a linux system with Python 3.7 and [clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) of the [forked version](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of this repository. 

## Setting up the project

* Install Python
```
https://realpython.com/installing-python/
```

* Installing Pipenv

We are using Pipenv for managing project development in a virtual environment and it is also the package manager here.
